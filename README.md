Rock, Paper, Scissors - C#
This project is a console-based game called "Rock Paper Scissors" implemented in C#. The game allows the player to compete against the computer by choosing between "rock," "paper," and "scissors." The computer's choice is generated randomly. The game is played in a best-of-five format, with the first player to win three rounds declared the winner.

The program uses a while loop to repeatedly play the game until the player chooses to exit. Inside the loop, the player's input is compared to the computer's choice using a switch statement. The outcome of each round is determined, and the scores of the player and computer are updated accordingly. The scores are displayed after each round.

Once a player reaches a score of three, indicating a win, the game ends, and the winner is declared. The player is then given the option to play again or exit the game.

Overall, this project showcases basic C# programming concepts, such as user input, random number generation, conditional statements, loops, and variable manipulation.
